## Project Title: Advanced Court Booking & Management System for Sports Facilities

**Project Overview:**
This project showcases a comprehensive and user-friendly system designed to manage court bookings and active sessions for sports facilities, such as squash or table tennis clubs. It provides a seamless experience for facility staff to oversee court availability, manage reservations, track ongoing sessions, and review past activity, all through an intuitive interface. The system handles the entire lifecycle of a court session, from initial booking to final payment and history logging.

**Key Features (as demonstrated by core components like `TabCourtCard`):**

*   **Real-time Court Status:** Clear visual indication of whether a court is "Available" or "In Use".
*   **Intuitive Tabbed Interface:** For each court, easily navigate between:
    *   **Upcoming Bookings:** View, create, edit, and cancel future reservations.
    *   **Active Session:** Manage the currently ongoing session, update its details, and initiate the end-of-session process.
    *   **Finished Sessions:** Access a historical log of completed sessions with their details.
*   **Comprehensive Booking Management:**
    *   Create new bookings with player information, selected times, and applicable rates.
    *   Modify or cancel existing upcoming bookings.
    *   Support for different court types (e.g., Squash, Table Tennis) and configurable hourly rates.
*   **Dynamic Active Session Control:**
    *   Seamlessly start sessions (from an existing booking or as a walk-in).
    *   Ability to update active session parameters (e.g., adding items/services, duration adjustments).
    *   Real-time calculation and display of session cost.
    *   Integrated end-of-session workflow, including payment method selection (e.g., cash, card).
*   **Detailed Session History:** Review past sessions, including duration, cost, and other relevant data.
*   **Modern & Responsive UI:**
    *   Clean, organized presentation of information.
    *   Interactive dialogs for booking, ending sessions, and viewing details.
    *   Smooth transitions and conditional styling for an enhanced user experience.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Developed using a modular approach with React, ensuring maintainability and scalability (as exemplified by the `TabCourtCard` component handling all aspects of a single court).

**Technology Stack (example based on developed components):**

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
*   **UI Components:** Custom-styled components (potentially using a library like Shadcn UI, inferred from naming and structure)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (inferred from utility classes)
*   **State Management:** Efficient state handling using React hooks and custom hooks (e.g., `useCourtSessions`) for managing complex session data and logic.
*   **Animation:** Subtle animations for improved user experience (e.g., using `framer-motion`).

**My Capabilities & Contribution:**

I have successfully designed and implemented core functionalities for this sophisticated court management system. The `TabCourtCard` component, for instance, is a testament to my ability to:

*   Develop complex, interactive, and stateful UI components using **React and TypeScript**.
*   Manage intricate application logic, encompassing the full lifecycle of court sessions (booking, active play, post-session processing).
*   Integrate various UI elements like tabs, lists, badges, and dialogs into a cohesive, intuitive, and user-friendly experience.
*   Architect front-end solutions with a focus on **reusability, maintainability, and performance**, employing custom hooks and modern React patterns.
*   Translate business requirements (such as variable hourly rates, session tracking, and payment processing) into robust technical features.
*   Ensure a high-quality user experience through thoughtful UI design and attention to detail.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in building dynamic web applications that solve real-world business problems. I am adept at taking complex requirements and transforming them into functional, elegant, and high-performance software.
